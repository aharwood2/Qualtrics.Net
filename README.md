# Qualtrics.Net
.NET Standard library which provides a C# wrapper for the Qualtrics XM REST API.

## Authentication
To use the library, you are required to provide your API token to the library so your REST calls can be authenticated. You can locate this API token on your Qualtrics Account page.

## Limitations
The Qualtrics API is substantial. Instead of attempting to support every API call, I just add the ones I need as I need them. If what you want isn't in the library yet then please consider contributing by forking and raising a PR.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute PRs for any missing API methods that you need or raise an issue on the tracker so someone can pick it up and add it for you. There is an established pattern and naming convention so please try to follow this when developing your features.
